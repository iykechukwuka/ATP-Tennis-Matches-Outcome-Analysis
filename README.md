# ATP-Tennis-Matches-Outcome-Analysis
This project aims to analyze historical ATP tennis match data to uncover patterns, trends, and factors influencing match outcomes. The dataset contains match-level details from various ATP tournaments, including information about the tournament, match rounds, player rankings, surface types, and betting odds.
The primary objectives of this project include:
•	Win Prediction: Analyze how player rankings and betting odds affect match outcomes.
•	Surface Analysis: Study how different court surfaces (Hard, Clay, Grass) impact player performance.
•	Player Insights: Identify trends in player performance based on rankings and implied probabilities.
•	Betting Market Efficiency: Compare the betting odds with actual match outcomes to evaluate the accuracy of implied probabilities.
The dataset consists of various fields such as tournament name, player rankings, odds, and surface types, making it a rich source for predictive modelling, performance evaluation, and sports betting analytics.
TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES:
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing data, standardizing formats, and converting numerical codes back to readable labels.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in player performance, court types, and win probabilities.
•	Predictive Modelling: Building models to predict match winners based on player statistics and betting odds.
•	Data Visualization: Creating informative visualizations to represent match outcomes, surface effects, and ranking impacts.
This project will provide actionable insights for tennis analysts, bettors, and sports enthusiasts by leveraging the data for win prediction and performance evaluation.
